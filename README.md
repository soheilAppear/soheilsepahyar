GitHub Pages personal site for Soheil Sepahyar.

## Important
If you ever see text like:
`<<<<<<< HEAD` or `>>>>>>> ...`
it means an unresolved Git merge conflict was committed into `index.html`.

Fix by replacing `index.html` with the clean version in this zip, then commit and push.

## Publish
1. Unzip.
2. Upload all files to the repo root (not inside a folder).
3. Commit to `main`.
4. GitHub Pages should deploy from `main` and `/ (root)`.
